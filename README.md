# Crime Analysis and Reporting System (C.A.R.S.)

## Overview

The Crime Analysis and Reporting System (C.A.R.S.) is a comprehensive application developed to address the challenges faced by law enforcement agencies in managing and reporting crime data. This system is designed with a strong focus on SQL, control flow statements, loops, arrays, collections, exception handling, database interaction, and unit testing.

## Project Structure

The project follows a modular structure to enhance maintainability and scalability. Here are the key components:

- **entity:** Contains entity classes that model real-world entities (Incidents, Victims, Suspects, Law Enforcement Agencies, Officers, Evidence, and Reports).

- **dao:** Includes the Service Provider interface (`ICrimeAnalysisService`) and its implementation (`CrimeAnalysisServiceImpl`) for database interactions. Methods in the interface cover functionalities like creating incidents, updating status, generating reports, etc.

- **exception:** Defines custom exceptions for error handling. The primary exception is `IncidentNumberNotFoundException`, which is thrown when a user enters an invalid incident number that doesn't exist in the database.

- **util:** Houses utility classes for database connection and property handling. The `DBUtil` class combines the functionality of `DBConnection` and `PropertyUtil`, providing methods to create and close connections, and read connection properties from a property file.

- **main:** Contains the `MainModule` class, which serves as the entry point and demonstrates the system's functionalities through a menu-driven application.

## Database Setup

The project assumes a MySQL database with the following schema:



## How to Run
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/CrimeAnalysisAndReportingSystem.git
Setup your database by executing the provided SQL script.

Modify the mysql.properties file in the resources directory with your database configuration.

Compile and run the MainModule class to start the application.

bash
Copy code
javac com/CrimeAnalysisAndReportingSystem/main/MainModule.java
java com.CrimeAnalysisAndReportingSystem.main.MainModule
Key Functionalities
The primary objectives of this project include:

Schema Design: Define entities with relationships such as Incidents with multiple Victims and Suspects, association of Incidents with Law Enforcement Agencies, Officers working for specific agencies, Evidence linked to Incidents, and Reports generated by Reporting Officers.

Database Interaction: Connect the application to a MySQL database using JDBC. The DBUtil class provides methods for establishing and closing connections.

Service Implementation: Implement service classes (CrimeAnalysisServiceImpl) for various functionalities defined in the ICrimeAnalysisService interface. These include creating incidents, updating status, generating reports, and more.

Exception Handling: Custom exceptions, including IncidentNumberNotFoundException, are defined and handled throughout the application.

Unit Testing: JUnit test cases are provided to ensure the correctness and reliability of the system.
